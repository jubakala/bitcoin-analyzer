This app has been tested only with Python 3.8 in macOS Big Sur version 11.5.1.

If you want to run this app locally, follow these instructions (I assume that you know equivalent commands of your local OS):

**Create virtual environment.**  
$ ```python3 -m venv venv```

**Activate the virtual environment.**  
$ ```source venv/bin/activate```

**Install dependencies. (The process may recommend to upgrade pip, but it can be ignored this time.)**  
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

**Run the app.**  
$ ```flask run``` or  ```python3 app.py```

**The app prompts the local url where it runs. Should be http://127.0.0.1:5000. Copy and paste the url to your favourite browser and you're good to test the app!**  

**To run the tests (optional):**  
$ ```python3 tests.py```

**Note**: This simple app was created to showcase my software development and Python programming skills, not my front- or back-end skills. This was my first webapp ever using Flask.
